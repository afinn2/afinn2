### Hi there, I'm Aidan
- I am a Senior at Notre Dame studying Classics with minors in Data Science and Philosophy of Science
- I co-founed a Cincinnati-centered virtual near-peer tutoring program called Tutor Teens that has, to date, provide over 5,000 hours of free tutoring
- I was honored with the 2021 US Presidential Scholarship by the US Department of Education

*Some of my experiences:*
- Co-founder of a virtual tutoring country called "Tutor Teens" that was recently (Spring 2025) acquired by a larger non-profit
- Research intern at the Lucy Institute for Data and Society
- Brand Analyst Intern at Brandrank.ai
- Long-time summer camp counselor

## I'm pretty new to this Data Science thing but have picked up a few skills:

- Beginner Python and Excel knowledge
- ArcGIS and Gephi experience

## This semester, I'd like to learn:
- How to make a github profile :)
- The fundamentals of Data Science so I can know what I don't know!
- What I can do with a Data Science profession

### Languages and Tools:
